  ## Description
 For this project we used Node and Express server, and index.js as the template engine. Rubbish Rumble is backed by a MySQL database. We utilized animate.css as the new package we have not used before. Utilized CRUD routes for retrieving and adding new data. Our app is deployed using Heroku (with data). The folder structure meets the MVC paradigm.
